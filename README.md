# Fake Video Classification using LSTM

### 1. Introduction
The Fake Video Classification project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to detect and classify deepfake videos. By analyzing the temporal patterns in video frames, the model can distinguish between genuine and manipulated content. This project also features a user-friendly website built with Flask, allowing users to easily upload and classify videos in real-time.

### 2. Directory Structure
For easier navigation, the project is organized as follows:

**Model Creation**  
This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for preprocessing the data, making predictions, and training the LSTM model. It showcases the step-by-step process of how the deepfake detection model is created.


**Model**  
The trained LSTM model is saved in this directory as `trained_model6.pt`. The model can be found at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ycyQwouJkzc7FRlCR_QbheJZvZgPI_7O/view?usp=sharing).


**Flask Application**  
This directory contains the Flask-based web application. Users can upload videos, which are then processed by the LSTM model to classify them as real or fake, with results displayed on the web interface.


### 3. System Architecture
The system architecture consists of a feature extraction pipeline followed by an LSTM model for video classification. The Flask application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading videos and viewing results.
